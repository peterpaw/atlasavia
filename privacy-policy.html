      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <div class="privacy-policy-wrapper">
        <p>
          Atlasavia (&#8220;<strong>Atlasavia</strong>&#8220;) operates
          atlasavia.de and may operate other websites. It is Atlasavia&#8217;s
          policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may
          collect while operating our websites.
        </p>
        <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
        <p>
          Like most website operators, Atlasavia collects
          non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
          and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
          language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
          visitor request. Atlasavia&#8217;s purpose in collecting
          non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
          Atlasavia&#8217;s visitors use its website. From time to time,
          Atlasavia may release non-personally-identifying information in the
          aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its
          website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Atlasavia also collects potentially personally-identifying information
          like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for
          users leaving comments on atlasavia.de blogs/sites. Atlasavia only
          discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
          circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
          information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and
          email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the
          blog/site where the comment was left.
        </p>
        <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
        <p>
          Certain visitors to Atlasavia&#8217;s websites choose to interact with
          Atlasavia in ways that require Atlasavia to gather
          personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
          that Atlasavia gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For
          example, we ask visitors who sign up at
          <a href="https://atlasavia.de/">atlasavia.de</a> to provide a username
          and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Atlasavia are
          asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the
          personal and financial information required to process those
          transactions. In each case, Atlasavia collects such information only
          insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the
          visitor&#8217;s interaction with Atlasavia. Atlasavia does not
          disclose personally-identifying information other than as described
          below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
          information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in
          certain website-related activities.
        </p>
        <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
        <p>
          Atlasavia may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
          websites. Atlasavia may display this information publicly or provide
          it to others. However, Atlasavia does not disclose
          personally-identifying information other than as described below.
        </p>
        <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
        <p>
          Atlasavia discloses potentially personally-identifying and
          personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
          contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
          information in order to process it on Atlasavia&#8217;s behalf or to
          provide services available at Atlasavia&#8217;s websites, and (ii)
          that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those
          employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located
          outside of your home country; by using Atlasavia&#8217;s websites, you
          consent to the transfer of such information to them. Atlasavia will
          not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
          personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its
          employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described
          above, Atlasavia discloses potentially personally-identifying and
          personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena,
          court order or other governmental request, or when Atlasavia believes
          in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the
          property or rights of Atlasavia, third parties or the public at large.
          If you are a registered user of an Atlasavia website and have supplied
          your email address, Atlasavia may occasionally send you an email to
          tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you
          up to date with what&#8217;s going on with Atlasavia and our products.
          If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our
          feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to
          help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other
          users. Atlasavia takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect
          against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of
          potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
          information.
        </p>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a
          visitor&#8217;s computer, and that the visitor&#8217;s browser
          provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Atlasavia uses
          cookies to help Atlasavia identify and track visitors, their usage of
          Atlasavia website, and their website access preferences. Atlasavia
          visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers
          should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using
          Atlasavia&#8217;s websites, with the drawback that certain features of
          Atlasavia&#8217;s websites may not function properly without the aid
          of cookies.
        </p>
        <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
        <p>
          If Atlasavia, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in
          the unlikely event that Atlasavia goes out of business or enters
          bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is
          transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such
          transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Atlasavia may continue
          to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
        </p>
        <h3>Ads</h3>
        <p>
          Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by
          advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad
          server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online
          advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your
          computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things,
          deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most
          interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by
          Atlasavia and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
        </p>
        <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
        <p>
          Although most changes are likely to be minor, Atlasavia may change its
          Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Atlasavia&#8217;s sole
          discretion. Atlasavia encourages visitors to frequently check this
          page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a atlasavia.de
          account, you might also receive an alert informing you of these
          changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this
          Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
